Design a Python program for a simple Library Management System with the following features:

1.Classes to implement:
Book: Represents a book with attributes like title, author, and availability.
Member: Represents a library member with attributes like name and borrowed_books.
Library: Manages books and members with methods for:
    Adding books to the library.
    Lending books to members.
    Returning borrowed books.
    Functionalities to implement:

2.Add new books to the library.
    Check the availability of a book before lending it.
    Allow a member to borrow multiple books (up to a specific limit).
    Allow members to return books.
    Display the list of available books in the library.

3.Error handling:
    Handle cases where a book is unavailable for borrowing.
    Prevent members from borrowing more than their allowed limit.
    Handle cases where a member tries to return a book they haven't borrowed.

4.Program flow:
    Provide a menu-driven interface for the user (admin or library member).
    Allow the user to perform actions like adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books.
    

5.Use OOP principles:
    Encapsulation (use private/protected attributes for classes).
    Class methods and attributes to manage library functionality.

6.Optional: Add data persistence using file handling or a database to save and retrieve library data.
