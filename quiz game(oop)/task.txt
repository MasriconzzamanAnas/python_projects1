The Quiz Game
A simple True/False game based on a series of questions. Follow these steps:

1.Create a Random Question Model:
    Define a class Question with the following attributes:
        text: The question text.
        answer: The correct answer (True/False).

2.Create a Question Bank:
    Create a list of Question objects, where each object represents a question with its answer.

3.Game Logic:
    Develop the following:
        Pull up one question at a time and let the user answer it.
        Check if the answer is correct and update the score.
        Check if the quiz has reached the end.
    Use the question_list attribute (a list of Question objects) and a question_number attribute to track progress through the quiz.

4.Create a Method in QuizBrain:
    Write a method to:
        Return a boolean indicating whether there are more questions to ask.

5.Add a Method to Check the Answer:
    Include a method to verify if the user’s answer is correct.
    Keep track of the score in the QuizBrain class.
